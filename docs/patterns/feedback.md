# Feedback Patterns

## Problem

Gathering user opinions, feelings, or experiences is essential for improving products, services, or systems, but it must be done in an effective and user-friendly way.

## Solution

Adopt a set of patterns that address different facets of feedback collection, tailoring the approach based on the specific context and forces at play.

## Context

In any situation where input from users, customers, or stakeholders is needed to understand preferences, satisfaction levels, or areas for improvement.

## Forces

* **Diversity of Responses**: People have varied preferences for giving feedback; some prefer structured questions, while others want open-ended options.

* **Complexity of Analysis**: The method of collection must align with the ability to analyze the feedback meaningfully.

* **Engagement Level Required**: Different methods may require different levels of user engagement and time commitment.

* **Sensitivity of Information**: The nature of the information may require particular care in how it is collected and handled.
